![Feline Presence Showcase](src/main/resources/assets/felinepresence/FelinePresence.png)

A Minecraft mod by **KeurDeLoup** that introduces the **Feline Presence** enchantment, allowing you to walk among creepers with the grace and safety of a cat.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🐱 Feline Presence Enchantment
*   **Behavior:** Creepers will actively avoid you, fleeing just as they do from Ocelots and Cats.
*   **Application:** Can only be applied to **Leggings**.

## 🐾 How to Find It

*Spending enough time alongside your feline companions may teach you more than you expect.*

### 🎁 Morning Gifts
**Feline Presence** cannot be obtained through enchanting tables, as it is a **Treasure Enchantment**.

Instead, tamed cats have a small chance to gift an **enchanted book** containing **Feline Presence** as part of their **morning gift** behavior.

The more cats you live with, and the luckier you are, the better your chances !

## 💥 Important Note
While **Feline Presence** causes creepers to avoid you, it does **not** make you completely safe.

If you get too close, creepers will still defend themselves and **explode**.  
This enchantment discourages approach, it does not prevent detonation.
