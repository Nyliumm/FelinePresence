## ✨ Features

### 🐱 Feline Presence Enchantment
*   **Behavior:** Creepers will actively avoid you, fleeing just as they do from Ocelots and Cats.
*   **Application:** Can only be applied to **Chest Armor**.
*   **Rarity:** This is a **Treasure Enchantment**. You won't find it on an enchanting table!
*   **Levels:** Unique (Single Level).

## 🏺 How to Find It
This enchantment is a rare relic of the Egyptian past. To obtain it, you must venture into **Trail Ruins**.

1.  Locate a **Trail Ruin** structure.
2.  Use a Brush on **Suspicious Gravel**.
3.  Specifically, look for the **Rare Archaeology** loot pools—if you're lucky, you'll find a **book** already imbued with Feline Presence.
